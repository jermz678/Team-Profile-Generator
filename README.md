# Team-Profile-Generator

## Use this app to create a webpage of your manager, engineers and interns.
## Type in the manager's name, ID, email, and office number.
## You can then choose to add an intern or an Engineer.  Each will ask for name, ID, and Email.  Intern will ask for school info, and Engineer will ask for github account.
## When you are done, you can choose "Finish building my team.".  
## A html file will be created, and you can view your team profiles.
## Email links will allow you to email each team member, and you can go directly to the Engineers Github Page.

## I used Javascript and run everything in Node.  I also used Inquirer and Jest.
## Thanks for looking!
